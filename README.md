# SoundInteractionWorkshop	

INTRODUCTION

This workshop will explore the use of physical computing for sound iteraction. We will introduce the students to the Arduino platform, a toolkit for interactive objects and installations hardware and software.
We will also help to enter the field of sound synthesis and effects with the help of the Pure Data. 
Finally, we will be able to join both concepts, sensing the analog world and responding with sound in real time.
The approach will be practical rather than theoretical, with a strong focus on artistic expression. At the end, students will be invited to present their ideas and works in progress.

AGENDA

- Day 1: Sensing the world: 
	
	Arduino is an open-source platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is aim to provide an inexpensive and easy way to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors.  

	We will start exploring the Arduino Board and the IDE, but  quickly move on to coverage of various electronic components. We will learn how with some simple code, the Arduino can read from a wide variety of sensors - things that can measure light, temperature, degree of flex, pressure, proximity, etc.


- Day 2: Creating sound: 
	
	Pure Data is a programming language for interactive computer music and multimedia works.
	We will cover the basics such as configuring Pure Data and the principles of visual programming.
	We will move on to the creation of sound synthesis, audio instruments and finally audio effects.  


- Day 3: Sound Interaction:  
	
	During this day we will learn how to interact between sound and the world through the use of sensors. We will learn how to connect the values read from the Arduino and send it to Pure Data.

	After that all the connected values will be able to manipulate any parameter created for the sound synthesis or audio effects. At the same time we would be able to trigger or stop samples and a lot more.

	This is the time to experiment and play around the possibilities that this bridge brings.
